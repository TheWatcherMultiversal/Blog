# Blog TheWatcherMultiversal
This is my blog and portfolio where I will publish all kinds of content related to the world of free and open source software. On this website I will keep all the changes about my projects along with the links of my projects on GitHub.

Those who want to help me improve the logic of the page and help me with the English translation of the page, send me a message through the information provided on my GitHub.
